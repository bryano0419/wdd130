    <h3>More information</h3>
    <p>
      Why are home repairs important?
    </p>


    <p> Safety: Regular home repair and maintenance can help prevent accidents and injuries. Faulty electrical wiring, leaky plumbing, and damaged flooring can pose a serious safety hazard to occupants of the home.
      Health: A well-maintained home can promote good health by preventing the growth of mold and mildew, improving indoor air quality, and ensuring that all systems are functioning properly.
      Comfort: Home repair can help ensure that a home is comfortable and functional. Repairs to heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems can help regulate the temperature and humidity in the home, while repairs to plumbing and electrical systems can ensure that water and power are readily available.
      Property value: Regular home repair and maintenance can help preserve the value of a home. Neglected repairs can lead to more extensive damage and costly repairs down the line, and can lower the overall value of the property.
      Aesthetics: Home repair and maintenance can help improve the appearance of a home, making it more attractive and appealing to occupants and visitors alike.
